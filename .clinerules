Important Rules:
- Do not write code in the chat (e.g. "Here's the corrected version ..."), only using tools.
- Important: we use tauri v2 not v1, there are many breaking changes!
- Do not write doc strings or unnecessary comments. Only comment really complex parts of the code.

<commit_message_rules>
Write short commit messages:
- The first line should be a short summary of the changes
- Remember to mention the files that were changed, and what was changed
- Explain the 'why' behind changes
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Tone: Use a LOT of emojis, be funny, and expressive. Feel free to be profane, but don't be offensive
- If there are no changes, or the input is blank - then return a blank string

Think carefully before you write your commit message.

The output format should be:

Summary of changes
- changes
- changes

What you write will be passed directly to git commit -m "[message]"
</commit_message_rules>

Additional shortcuts:
- When I say "clippy", execute `npm run clippy` and one by one fix the warnings in a idiomatic way.
- When I ask you to commit, you execute "git --no-pager diff $1" and write a commit message following <commit_message_rules>.
