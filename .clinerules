Important Rules:
- Do not write code in the chat (e.g. "Here's the corrected version ..."), only using tools.
- Important: we use tauri v2 not v1, there are many breaking changes!
- Do not write doc strings or unnecessary comments. Only comment really complex parts of the code.

Git Commit Message Rules:
- All commit messages must follow the conventional commit format
- Start with one of these types followed by a colon and space:
  * feat: New features or significant additions
  * fix: Bug fixes or error corrections
  * chore: Routine tasks, maintenance, or tooling changes
- After the type, write a concise description in present tense
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "adds" or "added")
- Examples:
  * feat: add global hotkey support
  * fix: resolve memory leak in audio capture
  * chore: update dependencies to latest versions
